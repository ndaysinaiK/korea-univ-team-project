Disclaimer: This is a school project, do not use it in production.

## Description:

Most companies need data to enhance their systems, and data comes from users who mostly don't get rewarded.
We built a prototype where users are rewarded for participating in patient data collection via a survey. 
This prototype can be used as a learning tool and improved for different use cases.
